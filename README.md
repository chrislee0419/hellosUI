# hello's UI

A modular UI base mod that serves as my personal alternative to halsafar's [SongBrowser](https://github.com/halsafar/BeatSaberSongBrowser). This mod is a rewrite/redesign of my [Enhanced Search And Filters](https://github.com/chrislee0419/EnhancedSearchAndFilters) mod.

*NOTE: Currently, this mod is incompatible with SongBrowser. Remove SongBrowser if you intend to use this mod along with any extension mods. I plan on removing this incompatibility in the future.*

**The latest version of this mod can be found [here](https://github.com/chrislee0419/hellosUI/releases)**.
